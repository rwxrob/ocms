# âš¡ OCMS Credentials

This repo contains a (growing) collection of credential requirements for
the Open Credential Merit System (OCMS, pronounced "Occam's") and are
designed to provide an overview of the skills, knowledge, and abilities
required to fulfill certain, specific roles. Currently, this is a work
in progress. Feel free to open issues for missing requirements you feel
are warranted. Hopefully, this will become a community effort. The goal
is to provide direction for those seeking to fill these roles
professionally and provide a reference -- built from professional
consensus -- for both learners and those who could mentor them (not
unlike Scouting Merit Badges).

## Selection Criteria

Some might wonder why unpopular -- even deprecated --  technologies are
included in some of these credentials. It is never enough to only learn
what is popular and trending. You should learn what is necessary to do
the job. Certainly, you can select jobs that avoid technologies that you
really despise, but generally you should still learn enough about such
technologies to speak from experience about them.

Ask the question, "Is this technology still used by more than 30% of the
industry?" If the answer is yes -- even if that technology is being
phased out -- then it is still required learning for anyone to
confidently claim proficiency in a given role that requires it, even if
only to migrate off of it to something new.
