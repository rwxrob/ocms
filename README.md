# âš¡ OCMS Credentials

This repo contains a (growing) collection of credential requirement
[specifications](spec) that follow the [Open Credential Merit
System](about) and are designed to provide an overview of the skills,
knowledge, and abilities required to fulfill certain, specific roles.

Currently, this is a work in progress. Feel free to open issues for
missing requirements you feel are warranted. Hopefully, this will become
a community effort. The goal is to provide direction for those seeking
to fill these roles professionally and provide a reference -- built from
professional consensus -- for both learners and those who could mentor
them (not unlike Scouting Merit Badges).

> ðŸ’¢ Avoid the title "Full Stack Developer" when you can. It is
useless for anything other than searching for potential jobs and has
become a source of frustration for many in the industry since no one can
agree on what it actually means. If you do insist on using this title
make sure you fulfill *all* the requirements for both Frontend and
Backend (which very few in the industry claiming the problematic "Full
Stack" title actually do).

## Selection Criteria

Some might wonder why unpopular -- even deprecated --  technologies are
included in some of these credentials. It is never enough to only learn
what is popular and trending. You should learn what is necessary to do
the job. Certainly, you can select jobs that avoid technologies that you
really despise, but generally you should still learn enough about such
technologies to speak from experience about them.

Ask the question, "Is this technology still used by more than 30% of the
industry?" If the answer is yes -- even if that technology is being
phased out -- then it is still required learning for anyone to
confidently claim proficiency in a given role that requires it, even if
only to migrate off of it to something new.
